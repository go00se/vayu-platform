# vayu-platform
Vayu is the god of the wind, breath and the life force in Hindu mythology, named after him this repository is a platform for CFD development. The concept behind this project is “for beginners made by beginners” I'm looking to document the entire process behind the CFD-solver, the issues, the speedbumps, the confusions, all of it.
